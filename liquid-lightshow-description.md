# Liquid Light Show Description

'70s festival visuals using colored soapy water and projected lenses involved creating liquid light shows, where operators used overhead projectors, colored oils/liquids (often with soapy elements for texture), and lenses/wheels to project swirling, abstract, psychedelic patterns in real-time, mimicking music's flow and creating immersive, hallucinatory environments alongside bands. These visuals, using techniques like light interference in thin films, generated mesmerizing, ever-changing colors and shapes, a hallmark of the psychedelic era. [1, 2, 3]  
Key Elements & Techniques: 

• Liquid Light Shows (Liquid Projections): The core technique, mixing oils, water, and dyes in glass tanks and projecting them with overhead projectors, creating dynamic, flowing abstract art. 
• Colored Soapy Water: Used for its thin film properties, creating iridescent, rainbow-like colors (light interference) that shift as the film thins and thickens, providing complex textures and patterns. 
• Overhead Projectors & Lenses: Modified slide and overhead projectors were used to magnify and project these liquid patterns onto screens. 
• Color Wheels & Filters: Added to projectors to introduce more color shifts, swirls, and movement, often synchronized with the music. 
• Projection & Manipulation: Operators would physically move the liquids, use heat, or employ lenses (like fisheye or prisms) to distort and amplify the projected colors and shapes. 
• Bubbles: While not the primary "liquid light" medium, large bubbles (perhaps enhanced with glycerin) were sometimes used or photographed for their natural iridescent effects, adding another layer of ethereal visuals, but the core was projected liquids. [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6]  

How it Worked (Simplified): 

1. Create the Medium: A mixture of water, oil, and dye (like food coloring or specific pigments) was placed in a glass dish. 
2. Project Light: An overhead projector shone light through the liquid mixture. 
3. Manipulate: An operator would stir, heat, or add soapy elements to the liquid, causing colors to swirl, separate, and form mesmerizing, fluid shapes. 
4. Lens Effects: Lenses and prisms would refract and distort these shapes, creating psychedelic, pulsating visuals that danced with the music. [1, 2, 3]  

This created an immersive, sensory experience central to 60s and 70s psychedelic rock concerts, a predecessor to modern digital visuals. [1, 2]
